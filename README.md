# EIS_simulator


Welcome to EIS simulator. 

To run, simply run the file EIS_Simulator_final.py
NOTE: Within the script there is a line to designate a path for the circuit configuration diagrams contained in the folder /Python images for EIS/.
Make sure to save this folder and to note its location. Then edit EIS_Simulator_final.py to reflect the location of this directory.
